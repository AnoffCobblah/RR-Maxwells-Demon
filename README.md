# RR-Maxwells-Demon
Recreational Reckoning scripts used to study the James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and the history of the Maxwell's Demon thought experiment.

Recreational reckoning is a methodology (which I am constantly updating) designed to visualize aspects of texts in order to prompt playful, experimental lines of thought which can then be pursued, if one wishes, with more traditional forms of research. the base fileset for the Recreational Reckoning methodology is available here: https://github.com/AnoffCobblah/RR-Recreational-Reckoning-Main.
